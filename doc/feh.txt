FEH(1)                    BSD General Commands Manual                   FEH(1)

NAME
     feh — image viewer and cataloguer

SYNOPSIS
     feh [options] files or directories or URLs ...

VERSION
     This manual documents feh 2.9.3

     Compile-time switches: libcurl support enabled, Xinerama support enabled,
     builtin EXIF support enabled

DESCRIPTION
     feh is a mode-based image viewer.  It is especially aimed at command line
     users who need a fast image viewer without huge GUI dependencies, though
     it can also be started by (graphical) file managers to view an image.

     feh supports filelists, various image sorting modes, image captions, HTTP
     and more.  Configurable keyboard shortcuts are used to control it; the
     mouse is also supported, but only required for very few actions.

     feh can also be used as wallpaper setter.

     A little note about EXIF support: The recommended way to display EXIF
     data is using exiv2 / exifgrep via --info (see the USAGE EXAMPLES
     section).  However, if you compile feh with exif=1, you can also display
     it directly.

MODES
     feh is based on various modes, which are selected at startup by command
     line options.

     Slideshow mode is the default.  It opens one window and displays the
     first image in it, the keyboard and mouse can be used to change slides
     (images).  In slideshow mode, images can be deleted either from the
     filelist or from the disk, the new filelist can then be saved to the disk
     and reopened at a later time.  An image can also be read from stdin via
     "feh -".

     Montage mode forms a montage from the filelist.  The resulting image can
     be viewed or saved, and its size can be limited by height, width or both.

     Index mode forms an index print from the filelist.  Image thumbnails are
     shown along with the filename, filesize and pixel size, printed using a
     truetype font of your choice.  The resulting image can be viewed or
     saved, and its size can be limited by height, width or both.

     Thumbnail mode is like index mode, but the mini-images are clickable and
     open the selected image in a new window.

     Multiwindow mode shows images in multiple windows, instead of as a
     slideshow in one window.  Don't use with a large filelist ;)

     List mode doesn't display images.  Outputs an ls - style listing of the
     files in the filelist, including image info such as size, pixels, type,
     etc.  Customlist mode will display whatever image info you want, in the
     format you choose.

     feh can also list either all the loadable files in a filelist or all the
     unloadable files.  Useful for preening a directory.

SUPPORTED FORMATS
     feh can open any format supported by Imlib2, most notably jpeg and png.
     If the convert binary (supplied by ImageMagick) is available, it also has
     limited support for many other filetypes, such as svg, xcf and otf. Use
     --magick-timeout num with a non-negative value to enable it.  For ani‐
     mated images, only the first frame is shown.

OPTIONS
     -A, --action [flag]action
             Specify a shell command as an action to perform on the image.  In
             slideshow or multiwindow mode, the action will be run when the
             action_0 key is pressed, in list mode, it will be run for each
             file.  In loadable/unloadable mode, it will be run for each load‐
             able/unloadable file, respectively.

             If flag is ";", feh will reload the current image instead of
             switching to the next one after executing the action.

             The action will be executed by /bin/sh.  Use format specifiers to
             refer to image info.  See FORMAT SPECIFIERS for examples.  E.g.
             "feh -A mv ~/images/%n *".  In slideshow mode, the next image
             will be shown after running the action, in multiwindow mode, the
             window will be closed.

     --action1 .. --action9
             Extra actions which can be set and triggered using the appropri‐
             ate number key.

     -Z, --auto-zoom
             Zoom pictures to screen size in fullscreen / fixed geometry mode.

     -x, --borderless
             Create borderless windows.

     -P, --cache-thumbnails
             Enable thumbnail caching in ~/.thumbnails.  Only works with
             thumbnails <= 256x256 pixels.

     -K, --caption-path path
             Path to directory containing image captions.  This turns on cap‐
             tion viewing, and if captions are found in path, which is rela‐
             tive to the directory of each image, they are overlayed on the
             displayed image.  E.g. with caption path "captions/", and viewing
             image "images/foo.jpg", the caption will be looked for in
             "images/captions/foo.jpg.txt".

     -L, --customlist format
             Don't display images, print image info according to format
             instead.  See FORMAT SPECIFIERS.

     --cycle-once
             Exit feh after one loop through the slideshow.

     -G, --draw-actions
             Draw the defined actions and what they do at the top-left of the
             image.

     --draw-exif
             (only if compiled with exif=1) display some EXIF information in
             the bottom left corner, similar to using --info with exiv2 /
             exifgrep .

     -d, --draw-filename
             Draw the filename at the top-left of the image.

     --draw-tinted
             Show overlay texts (as created by --draw-filename et al) on a
             semi-transparent background to improve their readability

     -f, --filelist file
             This option is similar to the playlists used by music software.
             If file exists, it will be read for a list of files to load, in
             the order they appear.  The format is a list of image filenames,
             absolute or relative to the current directory, one filename per
             line.

             If file doesn't exist, it will be created from the internal
             filelist at the end of a viewing session.  This is best used to
             store the results of complex sorts (-Spixels for example) for
             later viewing.

             Any changes to the internal filelist (such as deleting a file or
             it being pruned for being unloadable) will be saved to file when
             feh exits.  You can add files to filelists by specifying them on
             the command line when also specifying the list.

             If file is "-", feh will read the filelist from its standard
             input.

     -e, --font font
             Set global font.  Should be a truetype font, resident in the cur‐
             rent directory or the font directory, and should be defined in
             the form fontname/points, like "myfont/12".

     -C, --fontpath path
             Specify path as extra directory in which to search for fonts; can
             be used multiple times to add multiple paths.

     --force-aliasing
             Disable antialiasing for zooming, background setting etc.

     -I, --fullindex
             Same as index mode, but with additional information below the
             thumbnails.  Works just like "feh --index --index-info
             "%n\n%S\n%wx%h"".  Enables MONTAGE MODE OPTIONS.

             Note: This option needs to load all images to calculate the
             dimensions of the feh window, so when using it with many files it
             will take a while before a feh window is visible.  Use --preload
             to get a progress bar.

     -F, --fullscreen
             Make the window fullscreen.  Note that in this mode, large images
             will always be scaled down to fit the screen, --zoom zoom only
             affects smaller images and never scales larger than necessary to
             fit the screen size. The only exception is a zoom of 100, in
             which case images will always be shown at 100% zoom, no matter
             their dimensions.

     -g, --geometry [width x height] [+ x + y]
             Limit (and don't change) the window size.  Takes an X-style geom‐
             etry string like 640x480 with optional +x+y window offset.  Note
             that larger images will be zoomed out to fit, but you can see
             them at 1:1 by clicking the zoom button.  Note that this option
             does not enforce the geometry, changing it by a tiling WM or man‐
             ually is still possible.

     -Y, --hide-pointer
             Hide the pointer (useful for slideshows).

     -B, --image-bg style
             Use style as background for transparent image parts and the like.
             Accepted values: checks (default), white, black.

     -i, --index
             Enable Index mode.  Index mode is similar to montage mode, and
             accepts the same options.  It creates an index print of thumb‐
             nails, printing the image name beneath each thumbnail.  Index
             mode enables certain other options, see INDEX MODE OPTIONS and
             MONTAGE MODE OPTIONS.

     --index-info format
             Show image information based on format below thumbnails in index
             / thumbnail mode.  See FORMAT SPECIFIERS.  May contain newlines.

             Note: If you specify image-related formats (such as %w or %s),
             feh needs to load all images to calculate the dimensions of its
             own window.  So when using them with many files, it will take a
             while before a feh window becomes visible.  Use --preload to get
             a progress bar.

     --info commandline
             Execute commandline and display its output in the bottom left
             corner of the image.  Can be used to display e.g. image dimen‐
             sions or EXIF information.  Supports FORMAT SPECIFIERS.

     -k, --keep-http
             When viewing files using HTTP, feh normally deletes the local
             copies after viewing, or, if caching, on exit.  This option pre‐
             vents this so that you get to keep the local copies.  They will
             be in /tmp with "feh" in the name.

     --keep-zoom-vp
             When switching images, keep zoom and viewport settings (zoom
             level and X, Y offsets)

     -l, --list
             Don't display images.  Analyze them and display an ls(1) - style
             listing.  Useful in scripts to hunt out images of a certain
             size/resolution/type etc.

     -U, --loadable
             Don't display images.  Just print out their names if imlib2 can
             successfully load them.  Returns false if at least one image
             failed to load.

     --magick-timeout timeout
             Stop trying to convert unloadable files after timeout seconds. A
             negative value disables covert / magick support altogether, a
             value of zero causes feh to try indefinitely. By default, magick
             support is disabled.

     --max-dimension width x height
             Only show images with width <= width and height <= height.  If
             you only care about one parameter, set the other to either some‐
             thing large or -1.

     -M, --menu-font font
             Use font (truetype, with size, like "yudit/12") as menu font.

     --min-dimension width x height
             Only show images with width >= width and height >= height.  If
             you only care about one parameter, set the other to 0.

     -m, --montage
             Enable montage mode.  Montage mode creates a new image consisting
             of a grid of thumbnails of the images in the filelist.  When mon‐
             tage mode is selected, certain other options become available.
             See MONTAGE MODE OPTIONS.

     -w, --multiwindow
             Disable slideshow mode.  With this setting, instead of opening
             multiple files in slideshow mode, multiple windows will be
             opened; one per file.

     --no-jump-on-resort
             Don't jump to the first image after resorting the filelist.

     -N, --no-menus
             Don't load or show any menus.

     --no-screen-clip
             By default, window sizes are limited to the screen size.  With
             this option, windows will have the size of the image inside them.
             Note that they may become very large this way, making them unman‐
             ageable in certain window managers.

     --no-xinerama
             Disable Xinerama support.  Only makes sense when you have Xin‐
             erama support compiled in.

     -j, --output-dir directory
             Save files to directory (only useful with -k)

     -p, --preload
             Preload images.  This doesn't mean hold them in RAM, it means run
             through them and eliminate unloadable images first.  Otherwise
             they will be removed as you flick through.  This also analyses
             the images to get data for use in sorting, such as pixel size,
             type etc.  A preload run will be automatically performed if you
             specify one of these sort modes.

     -q, --quiet
             Don't report non-fatal errors for failed loads.  Verbose and
             quiet modes are not mutually exclusive, the first controls infor‐
             mational messages, the second only errors.

     -z, --randomize
             When viewing multiple files in a slideshow, randomize the file
             list before displaying.

     -r, --recursive
             Recursively expand any directories in the commandline arguments
             to the content of those directories, all the way down to the bot‐
             tom level.

     -R, --reload int
             Reload filelist and current image after int seconds.  Useful for
             viewing HTTP webcams or frequently changing directories.  (Note
             that the filelist reloading is still experimental.)

             If an image is removed, feh will either show the next one or
             quit.  However, if an image still exists, but can no longer be
             loaded, feh will continue to try loading it.

     -n, --reverse
             Reverse the sort order.  Use this to invert the order of the
             filelist.  E.g. to sort in reverse width order, use -nSwidth.

     -., --scale-down
             When not in fullscreen: Scale images to screen size if they are
             too big.

             In tiling environments, this also causes the image to be centered
             in the window.

     -D, --slideshow-delay float
             For slideshow mode, wait float seconds between automatically
             changing slides.  Useful for presentations.  Specify a negative
             number to set the delay (which will then be float * (-1)), but
             start feh in paused mode.

     -S, --sort sort_type
             The file list may be sorted according to image parameters.
             Allowed sort types are: name, filename, mtime, width, height,
             pixels, size, format.  For sort modes other than name, filename,
             or mtime, a preload run will be necessary, causing a delay pro‐
             portional to the number of images in the list.

             The mtime sort mode sorts images by most recently modified. To
             sort by oldest first, reverse the filelist with --reverse.

     -|, --start-at filename
             Start the filelist at filename.  See USAGE EXAMPLES.

     -T, --theme theme
             Load options from config file with name theme - see THEMES CONFIG
             SYNTAX for more info.  Note that commandline options always over‐
             ride theme options.  The theme can also be set via the program
             name (e.g. with symlinks), so by default feh will look for a
             "feh" theme.

     -t, --thumbnails
             Same as Index mode, but the thumbnails are clickable image
             launchers.  Note that --fullscreen and --scale-down do not affect
             the thumbnail window. They do, however, work for image windows
             launched from thumbnail mode.  Also supports MONTAGE MODE
             OPTIONS.

     -~, --thumb-title string
             Set title for windows opened from thumbnail mode.  See also
             FORMAT SPECIFIERS.

     -^, --title title
             Set window title.  Applies to all windows except those opened
             from thumbnail mode.  See FORMAT SPECIFIERS.

     -u, --unloadable
             Don't display images.  Just print out their names if imlib2 can
             NOT successfully load them.  Returns false if at least one image
             was loadable.

     -V, --verbose
             output useful information, progress bars, etc.

     -v, --version
             output version information and exit.

     --zoom percent | max | fill
             Zoom images by percent when in full screen mode or when window
             geometry is fixed.  When combined with --auto-zoom, zooming will
             be limited to the specified percent.  Specifying max is like set‐
             ting --auto-zoom, using fill makes feh zoom the image like the
             --bg-fill mode.

MONTAGE MODE OPTIONS
     These additional options can be used for index, montage and (partially)
     thumbnail mode.

     -a, --alpha int
             When drawing thumbnails onto the background, set their trans‐
             parency level to int (0 - 255).

     -b, --bg file | trans
             Use file as background for your montage.  With this option speci‐
             fied, the montage size will default to the size of file if no
             size restrictions were specified.  Alternatively, if file is
             "trans", the background will be made transparent.

     -X, --ignore-aspect
             By default, the montage thumbnails will retain their aspect
             ratios, while fitting into thumb-width/-height.  This options
             forces them to be the size set by --thumb-width and
             --thumb-height.  This will prevent any empty space in the final
             montage.

     -H, --limit-height pixels
             Limit the height of the montage.

     -W, --limit-width pixels
             Limit the width of the montage, defaults to 800 pixels.

             If both --limit-width and --limit-height are specified, the mon‐
             tage will be exactly width x height pixels in dimensions.

     -o, --output file
             Save the created montage to file.

     -O, --output-only file
             Just save the created montage to file without displaying it.

     -s, --stretch
             Normally, if an image is smaller than the specified thumbnail
             size, it will not be enlarged.  If this option is set, the image
             will be scaled up to fit the thumbnail size.  Aspect ratio will
             be maintained unless --ignore-aspect is specified.

     -E, --thumb-height pixels
             Set thumbnail height.

     -y, --thumb-width pixels
             Set thumbnail width.

     -J, --thumb-redraw n
             Only relevant for --thumbnails: Redraw thumbnail window every n
             images.  In feh <= 1.5, the thumbnail image used to be redrawn
             after every computed thumbnail (so, it updated immediately).
             However, since the redrawing takes quite long (especially for
             thumbnail mode on a large filelist), this turned out to be a
             major performance penalty.  As a workaround, the thumbnail image
             is redrawn every 10th image now by default. Set n = 1 to get the
             old behaviour, n = 0 will only redraw once all thumbnails are
             loaded.

INDEX MODE OPTIONS
     -@, --title-font font
             Set font to print a title on the index, if no font is specified,
             no title will be printed.

BACKGROUND SETTING
     feh can also be used as a background setter.  Unless you pass the
     --no-fehbg option, it will store the command line necessary to set the
     background in ~/.fehbg, so to have your background restored every time
     you start X, you can add "eval $(cat ~/.fehbg)" to your X startup script
     (like ~/.xinitrc).

     Note that all options except --bg-tile support Xinerama.  For instance,
     if you have multiple screens connected and use e.g.  --bg-center, feh
     will center the image on each screen.  You may even specify more than one
     file, in that case, the first file is set on screen 0, the second on
     screen 1, and so on.

     Use --no-xinerama to treat the whole X display as one screen when setting
     wallpapers.

     --bg-center
             Center the file on the background.  If it is too small, it will
             be surrounded by a black border

     --bg-fill
             Like --bg-scale, but preserves aspect ratio by zooming the image
             until it fits.  Either a horizontal or a vertical part of the
             image will be cut off

     --bg-max
             Like --bg-fill, but scale the image to the maximum size that fits
             the screen with black borders on one side.

     --bg-scale
             Fit the file into the background without repeating it, cutting
             off stuff or using borders.  But the aspect ratio is not pre‐
             served either

     --bg-tile
             Tile (repeat) the image in case it is too small for the screen

     --no-fehbg
             Do not write a ~/.fehbg file

CONFIGURATION
     feh has three config files: themes for theme definitions, keys for key
     bindings and buttons for mouse button bindings.  It will try to read them
     from $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/feh/, which (when XDG_CONFIG_HOME is unset)
     defaults to ~/.config/feh/.  If the files are not found in that direc‐
     tory, it will also try /etc/feh/.

     All config files treat lines starting with a "#" character as comments.
     Note that mid-line comments are not supported.

THEMES CONFIG SYNTAX
     .config/feh/themes allows the naming of option groups, called themes.

     It takes entries of the form "theme options ...", where theme is the name
     of the entry and options are the options which will be applied when the
     theme is used.

     An example entry would be "imagemap -rVq --thumb-width 40 --thumb-height
     30".

     You can use this theme in two ways.  Either call "feh -Timagemap *.jpg"
     or create a symbolic link to feh with the name of the theme you want it
     to use.  So from the example above: "ln -s `which feh ` ~/bin/imagemap".
     Now just run "imagemap *.jpg" to use these options.

     Note that you can split a theme over several lines by placing a backslash
     at the end of a line, like in the shell.

     You can combine these themes with commandline options.

KEYS CONFIG SYNTAX
     .config/feh/keys defines key bindings.  It has entries of the form
     "action [key1 [key2 [key3]]]".

     Each key is an X11 keysym name as shown by xev(1), like "Delete".  It may
     optionally start with modifiers for things like Control, in which case
     key looks like mod-keysym (for example "C-Delete" for Ctrl+Delete or
     "C-1-Delete" for Ctrl+Alt+Delete)

     Available modifiers are C for Control, S for Shift and 1, 4 for Mod1 and
     Mod4.  To match an uppercase letter like "S" instead of "s", the Shift
     modifier is not required.

     Specifying an action without any keys unbinds it (i.e. the default bind‐
     ings are removed).

     Note: Do not use the same keybinding for multiple actions.  feh does not
     check for conflicting bindings, so their behaviour is undefined.  Either
     unbind the unwanted action, or bind it to another unused key.  The order
     in which you bind / unbind does not matter, though.

     For a list of the action names, see KEYS.

KEYS
     In an image window, the following keys may be used (The strings in
     [square brackets] are the config action names):

     a [toggle_actions]
             Toggle actions display (see --draw-actions)

     A [toggle_aliasing]
             Enable/Disable anti-aliasing

     c [toggle_caption]
             Caption entry mode.  If --caption-path has been specified, then
             this enables caption editing.  The caption at the bottom of the
             screen will turn yellow and can be edited.  Hit return to confirm
             and save the caption, or escape to cancel editing.  Note that you
             can insert an actual newline into the caption using
             ⟨CTRL+return⟩.

     d [toggle_filenames]
             Toggle filename display (see --draw-filename)

     e [toggle_exif]
             (only if compiled with exif=1) Toggle EXIF tag display

     f [save_filelist]
             Save the current filelist as "feh_PID_ID_filelist"

     h [toggle_pause]
             Pause/Continue the slideshow.  When it is paused, it will not
             automatically change slides based on --slideshow-delay.

     i [toggle_info]
             Toggle info display (see --info)

     k [toggle_keep_vp]
             Toggle zoom and viewport keeping. When enabled, feh will keep
             zoom and X, Y offset when switching images.

     m [toggle_menu]
             Show menu.  Use the arrow keys and return to select items,
             ⟨escape⟩ to close the menu.

     n, ⟨Space⟩, ⟨Right⟩ [next_img]
             Show next image

     o [toggle_pointer]
             Toggle pointer visibility

     p, ⟨Backspace⟩, ⟨Left⟩ [prev_img]
             Show previous image

     q, ⟨Escape⟩ [quit]
             Quit feh

     r [reload_image]
             Reload current image.  Useful for webcams

     s [save_image]
             Save the current image as "feh_PID_ID_FILENAME"

     v [toggle_fullscreen]
             Toggle fullscreen

     w [size_to_image]
             Change window size to fit current image size

     x [close]
             Close current window

     z [jump_random]
             Jump to a random position in the current filelist

     <, > [orient_3, orient_1]
             In place editing - rotate the images 90 degrees (counter)clock‐
             wise.  The rotation is lossless, but may create artifacts in some
             image corners when used with JPEG images.  Rotating in the
             reverse direction will make them go away.  See jpegtran(1) for
             more about lossless JPEG rotation.  Note: jpegtran does not
             update EXIF orientation tags. However, feh assumes that you use
             the feature to normalize image orientation and want it to be dis‐
             played this way everywhere. After every rotation, it will uncon‐
             ditionally set the EXIF orientation to 1 ("0,0 is top left").
             Should you need to reverse this, see jpegexiforient(1).

     _ [flip]
             In place editing - vertical flip

     | [mirror]
             In place editing - horizontal flip.  Again, see jpegtran(1) for
             more information.

     0 .. 9 [action_0 .. action_9]
             Execute the corresponding action (0 = --action, 1 = --action1
             etc.)

     ⟨Return⟩ [action_0]
             Run the command defined by --action

     ⟨home⟩ [jump_first]
             Show first image

     ⟨end⟩ [jump_last]
             Show last image

     ⟨page up⟩ [jump_fwd]
             Go forward ~5% of the filelist

     ⟨page down⟩ [jump_back]
             Go backward ~5% of the filelist

     + [reload_plus]
             Increase reload delay by 1 second

     - [reload_minus]
             Decrease reload delay by 1 second

     ⟨delete⟩ [remove]
             Remove current file from filelist

     ⟨CTRL+delete⟩ [delete]
             Remove current file from filelist and delete it

     ⟨keypad left⟩, ⟨Ctrl+Left⟩ [scroll_left]
             Scroll to the left

     ⟨keypad right⟩, ⟨Ctrl+Right⟩ [scroll_right]
             Scroll to the right

     ⟨keypad up⟩, ⟨Ctrl+Up⟩ [scroll_up]
             Scroll up

     ⟨keypad down⟩, ⟨Ctrl+Down⟩ [scroll_down]
             Scroll down.  Note that the scroll keys work without anti-alias‐
             ing for performance reasons, hit the render key after scrolling
             to antialias the image.

     ⟨Alt+Left [scroll_left_page]⟩
             Scroll to the left by one page

     ⟨Alt+Right [scroll_right_page]⟩
             Scroll to the right by one page

     ⟨Alt+Up [scroll_up_page]⟩
             Scroll up by one page

     ⟨Alt+Down [scroll_down_page]⟩
             Scroll down by one page

     R, ⟨keypad begin⟩ [render]
             Antialias the image

             Highlight previous menu item

     ⟨Down⟩ [menu_down]
             Highlight next menu item

     ⟨Left⟩ [menu_parent]
             Highlight parent menu item

     ⟨Right⟩ [menu_child]
             Highlight child menu item

     ⟨Return⟩, ⟨Space⟩ [menu_select]
             Select highlighted menu item

BUTTONS CONFIG SYNTAX
     .config/feh/buttons.  This works like the keys config file: the entries
     are of the form "action [binding]".

     Each binding is a button name.  It may optionally start with modifiers
     for things like Control, in which case binding looks like mod-button (for
     example C-1 for Ctrl + Left button).

     Note: Do not use the same button for multiple actions.  feh does not
     check for conflicting bindings, so their behaviour is undefined.  Either
     unbind the unwanted action, or bind it to another unused button.  The
     order in which you bind / unbind does not matter, though.

     For the available modifiers, see KEYS CONFIGURATION SYNTAX.

   BUTTONS
     In an image window, the following buttons may be used (The strings in
     [square brackets] are the config action names):

     [reload]
             Reload current image

     1 ⟨left mouse button⟩ [pan]
             pan the current image

     2 ⟨middle mouse button⟩ [zoom]
             Zoom the current image

     3 ⟨right mouse button⟩ [menu]
             Toggle menu

     4 ⟨mousewheel down⟩ [prev]
             Show previous image

     5 ⟨mousewheel up⟩ [next]
             Show next image

     Ctrl+1 [blur]
             Blur current image

     Ctrl+2 [rotate]
             Rotate current image

     unbound [zoom_in]
             Zoom in

     unbound [zoom_out]
             Zoom out

MOUSE ACTIONS
     Default Bindings: When viewing an image, mouse button 1 pans the image
     (moves it around) or, when only clicked, moves to the next image
     (slideshow mode only).  Quick drags with less than 2px of movement per
     axis will be treated as clicks to aid graphics tablet users.  Mouse but‐
     ton 2 zooms (click and drag left->right to zoom in, right->left to zoom
     out, click once to restore zoom to 100%) and mouse button 3 opens the
     menu.

     CTRL+Button 1 blurs or sharpens the image (drag left to blur, right to
     sharpen); CTRL+Button 2 rotates the image around the center point.

     A note about pan and zoom modes: In pan mode, if you reach a window bor‐
     der but haven't yet panned to the end of the image, feh will warp your
     cursor to the opposite border so you can continue panning.

     When clicking the zoom button and immediately releasing it, the image
     will be back at 100% zoom.  When clicking it and moving the mouse while
     holding the button down, the zoom will be continued at the previous zoom
     level.  The zoom will always happen so that the pixel on which you
     entered the zoom mode remains stationary.  So, to enlarge a specific part
     of an image, click the zoom button on that part.

SIGNALS
     In slideshow mode, feh handles the following signals:

     SIGUSR1
             Switch to next image

     SIGUSR2
             Switch to previous image

USAGE EXAMPLES
     Here are some examples of useful option combinations. See also:
     ⟨http://feh.finalrewind.org/examples/⟩

     feh /opt/images
             Show all images in /opt/images

     feh -r /opt/images
             Recursively show all images found in /opt/images and subdirecto‐
             ries

     feh -rSfilename /opt/images
             Same as above, but sort by filename. By default, feh will show
             files in the order it finds them on the hard disk, which is usu‐
             ally somewhat random.

     feh -t -Sfilename -E 128 -y 128 -W 1024 /opt/images
             Show 128x128 pixel thumbnails, limit window width to 1024 pixels.

     feh -t -Sfilename -E 128 -y 128 -W 1024 -P -C
             /usr/share/fonts/truetype/ttf-dejavu/ -e DejaVuSans/8 /opt/images
             Same as above, but enable thumbnail caching in ~/.thumbnails and
             use a smaller font.

     feh -irFarial/14 -O index.jpg /opt/images
             Make an index print of /opt/images and all directories below it,
             using 14 point Arial to write the image info under each thumb‐
             nail.  Save the image as index.jpg and don't display it, just
             exit.  Note that this even works without a running X server

     feh --unloadable -r /opt/images
             Print all unloadable images in /opt/images, recursively

     feh -f by_width -S width --reverse --list .
             Write a list of all images in the directory to by_width, sorted
             by width (widest images first)

     feh -w /opt/images/holidays
             Open each image in /opt/images/holidays in its own window

     feh -FD5 -Sname /opt/images/presentation
             Show the images in .../presentation, sorted by name, in
             fullscreen, automatically change to the next image after 5 sec‐
             onds

     feh -rSwidth -A "mv %F ~/images/%N" /opt/images
             View all images in /opt/images and below, sorted by width, move
             an image to ~/image/image_name when enter is pressed

     feh --start-at ./foo.jpg .
             View all images in the current directory, starting with foo.jpg.
             All other images are still in the slideshow and can be viewed
             normally

     feh --start-at foo.jpg *
             Same as above

     feh --info "exifgrep '(Model|DateTimeOriginal|FNumber|ISO|Flash)' %F |
             cut -d . -f 4-" .
             Show some EXIF information, extracted by exifprobe/exifgrep

     feh --action 'rm %F' -rl --max-dim 1000x800
             Resursively remove all images with dimensions below or equal to
             1000x800 pixels from the current directory.

TILING WINDOW MANAGERS
     feh was created with a floating window layout in mind.  However, as of
     2.0.1, it has limited support for tiling window managers.

     Specifically, the --scale-down and --auto-zoom options will detect a
     tiling environment and scale the image up / down to the current window
     size.  Unfortunately, this causes every image to be rendered twice: First
     in a normal fashion, and then (after noticing that the window is being
     tiled) again with the correct zoom level.

     This is a known bug and will hopefully get fixed some time. For now, it
     can be avoided by using --geometry 500x500 (or any other geometry).  This
     will have the same behaviour as --scale-down, but without the flickering.

DEPENDENCIES
     feh requires the jpegtran and jpegexiforient binaries (usually
     distributed in "libjpeg-progs" or similar) for lossless rotation.

     To view images from URLs such as http://, you need feh compiled with
     libcurl support (enabled by default).  See the VERSION section.

BUGS
     Thumbnail mode is somewhat inefficient, and because of that not nearly as
     fast as it could be.

     --scale-down does not take window decorations into account and may there‐
     fore make the window slightly too large.

   REPORTING BUGS
     If you find a bug, please report it to ⟨derf+feh@finalrewind.org⟩ or via
     ⟨http://github.com/derf/feh/issues⟩.  You are also welcome to direct any
     feh-related comments/questions/... to #feh on irc.oftc.net.

     Please include the feh version ⟨the output of "feh --version"⟩, steps to
     reproduce the bug and, if necessary, images to reproduce it.

FUTURE PLANS
     Plans for the following releases:
     ·   Make zoom options more intuitive
